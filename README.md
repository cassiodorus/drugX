# drugX
This contains my proof of principle graph visualization of drug-drug and drug-food interactions. I have used data provided to me by Drugbank.com under an academic license, so while I cannot redistribute the data, I can present its uses.

I'm keeping this very simple and presuming that anyone who views this is already familiar with Drugbank.com, particularly its public-facing, free to use, drug interaction pages.

Initial preparation of the data was in R. I will provide those scripts if anyone is interested it. Also, I will provide data formats of the prepared files upon request. My main purpose here is to display a small number of graph visualizations.
